# Brain-Tumor-Classification
A website for classifying brain tumor images. I started by collecting and categorizing the images into two groups. After processing and normalizing the data, I built a binary classification (CNN). The model was trained using binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer, and its performance was evaluated on a test set.
